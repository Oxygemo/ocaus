# Odyssey346's CreatorsTF Assetpack Update Script (OCAUS)
Update Creators.tf asset pack without the bloatware (electron)!
# Required Libraries
If you're using a normal distribution, like Ubuntu, Mint, PopOS, Manjaro, Fedora and OpenSUSE, you probably dont need to do this. But for people with minimal setups (Arch and Gentoo), install followng packages:
```
wget
mv
unzip
```
# How to Install
do this:
```
git clone https://github.com/Oxygemo/ocaus
cd ocaus
chmod +x ocaus.sh
./ocaus.sh
```
Watch it go. 

Please report any issues you find. I don't usually play TF2, I don't even have it currently installed.

# Windows Support?
no fuck off normie
